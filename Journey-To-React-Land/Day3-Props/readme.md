Imagine you have a bunch of LEGO bricks. Each brick is like a different piece of information that you want to use in your LEGO creation. Props are like the messages you send to each LEGO brick to tell them what color to be, how tall to stack, or what shape to take.

Example 1: LEGO People
Imagine you're building a LEGO city:

You have little LEGO people.

Each LEGO person can have different hair colors and clothes.

Props are like little notes you attach to each person telling them what color hair and clothes to wear.
     
       // In code:
          <LEGOPerson hairColor="blonde" clothes="red-shirt" />
          <LEGOPerson hairColor="brown" clothes="blue-shirt" />


## Formal Definition for Understanding:
Now, for a more formal explanation that sums it up:

Props (short for properties) in React are like messages or special instructions you can give to each component (like LEGO people or pets in our examples). They're used to pass data from one component to another. This data can be simple things like colors, names, numbers, or even whole pieces of content like text or images.
